    "While non-marketplace simulations are focused on a number of consumers experiencing and leaving ratings of a single product, marketplace simulations allow to conduct a similar exercise but including a whole range of ___P___ different products from which consumers can choose. Accordingly, the journey of virtual consumers through the marketplace simulation will be in part similar to that of a non-marketplace one, with the main difference that now each of them will have to choose which particular product to buy from those available. Once this selection process takes place the consumer goes through the rest of the steps that will determine whether a rating is posted or not (formulating expectations, experiencing the product etc.). Moreover, multiple marketplaces can be included in a single simulation so you can think of a marketplace simulation as being composed of ___M___ different marketplaces, including  ___P___ different simulated products each from which simulated consumers can choose.\n"

Alternatively, the simulation of a marketplace will also be concluded automatically if this number of ratings has not been reached by the time that an amount of consumers 30 times larger have visited the marketplace. E.g. In a case where this argument is set to 10, if by the time 300 consumers have been simulated less than 10 ratings have been posted the simulation will be concluded automatically.\n",

Their functioning and interpretation are exactly the same as for non-marketplace simulations except for the 'review_prior' argument, whose interpretation differs intuitively in the sense that it does not only apply to the single product considered in a non-marketplace simulation, but to all products across all marketplaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __review_prior__: Set of initial ratings for the products that are pre-loaded before the simulation starts, taking the shape of an array of five integer values. By default, this is set as an array of five 1s. This implies that by the time a product within a marketplace is purchased for the first time, the consumer that has done so will observe 5 prior reviews, each of them assigned to one of the five values composing the rating scale [1 - 5]. \n",

    "\n",
    "- __tendency_to_rate__: Underlying tendency to rate for all consumers taking float values in the interval [0,1]. In other words, this is the proportion of consumers that will post a rating regardless of the value of the rho parameter(s) and the difference between their actual and expected product experience. If set at the default value of 0.05, 5% of all consumers will post a rating independently of the other factors at play in the simulation. This is necessary to address the \"cold start\" problem where by random chance for some products, we might have high enough values of rho that no visitors ever leave a rating.\n",

Returns the timeseries of the simulated ratings, in a cumulative histogram format (so, the order of rating accumulation is preserved) if \"timeseries\" is chosen. For \"histogram\", returns the final histogram of ratings (and throws away the order of rating accumulation). \n",

    "- __previous_rating_measure__: Measure of previous ratings that will be taken as a reference when experiencing herding behavior. It can be either the mean, the mode or the latest review posted. For example, if a consumer leaves a rating being subject to herding and this parameter is set as mode, it will herd towards the mode of all previous reviews. This argument is specific to the Herding and Double herding simulations and takes the strings \"mode\", \"mean\" and \"latest\" as valid inputs.\n",

    "Since this tutorial was first written a new kind of non-marketplace simulator, the Rating Scale simulation, has been implemented. It is represented by the RatingScaleSimulator class, which is a child class of the HerdingSimulator class. Its main addition is to introduce 5 new parameters that create a rating scale to determine the value of the review that each consumer will post (1 to 5 stars) depending on the difference between its expected and actual experience with the product (delta). This rating scale is delimited by the following two elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __five_star_highest_limit__: Upper bound for delta that will result in a 5-star rating. The actual limit will lie between `five_star_highest_limit` and `five_star_highest_limit` * 0.5. If delta is larger than this limit, the user's review will be a 5-star one. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __one_star_lowest_limit__:  Lower bound for delta that will result in a 1-star rating. The actual limit will lie between `one_star_lowest_limit` and `one_star_lowest_limit` * 0.5. If delta is lower than this limit, the user's review will be a 1-star one. \n",
    "\n",
    "Considering these two limits the rating scale is governed by the following four parameters introduced by the Rating Scale simulator:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __P5__: taking values between 0.5 and 1, it determines the limit to which delta is compared to get a 5-star rating. Such limit will be equivalent to: five_star_highest_limit * p5. Thus, for example, if p5 = 1 then the limit will be five_star_highest_limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __P4__: taking values between 0.25 and 0.75, it determines the limit to which delta is compared to get a 4-star rating. Such limit will be equivalent to: five_star_highest_limit * p5 * p4.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __P1__: taking values between 0.5 and 1, it determines the limit to which delta is compared to get a 1-star rating. Such limit will be equivalent to: one_star_lowest_limit * p1. Thus, for example, if p1 = 1 then the limit will be one_star_lowest_limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. __P2__: taking values between 0.25 and 0.75, it determines the limit to which delta is compared to get a 2-star rating. Such limit will be equivalent to: one_star_lowest_limit * p1 * p2.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Having this in mind, 3-star ratings will come from the space where delta is in between one_star_lowest_limit * p1 * p2 to zero, and from zero to five_star_highest_limit * p5 * p4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the fifth parameter introduced by the rating scale simulator is:\n",
    "\n",
    "5. __bias_5_star__ : Probability that a user is biased towards five stars and leaves a 5 star rating irrespective of its product experience."
