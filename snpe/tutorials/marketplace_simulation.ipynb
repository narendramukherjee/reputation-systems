    "While non-marketplace simulations are focused on a number of consumers experiencing and leaving ratings of a single product, marketplace simulations allow to conduct a similar excercise but including a whole range of ___P___ different products from which consumers can choose between. Accordingly the journey of virtual consumers through the marketplace simulation will be in part similar to that of a non-marketplace one, with the main difference that now each of them will have to choose which particular product to buy from those available. Once this selection process takes place the consumer goes through the rest of the steps that will determine whether a rating is posted or not (formulating expectations, experiencing the product etc.). Moreover multiple marketplaces can be included in a single simulation so you can think of a marketplace simulation as being composed of ___M___ different marketplaces, including  ___P___ different simulated products each from which simulated consumers are able to choose.\n"

By default this is set as an array os five 1s.

If set at the default value of 0.05, 5% of all consumers will post a rating independently of the other factors at play in the simulation.This is necessary to address the \"cold start\" problem where by random chance for some products, we might have high enough values of rho that no visitors ever leave a rating.\n",

For \"histogram\", returns the final histogram of ratings (and throws away the order of rating accumulation). \n",
